Chemtrail [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/minifast/chemtrail.png)](https://travis-ci.org/minifast/chemtrail) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/minifast/chemtrail.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/minifast/chemtrail)
==========

Chemtrail lets you build and test CloudFormation templates.


Origin
------

Gems like [cloud_formatter](https://github.com/songkick/cloud_formatter),
[cloud_builder](https://github.com/Optaros/cloud_builder) and
[cfndsl](https://github.com/howech/cfndsl) are pretty cool for building small
CloudFormation stacks.  A more complex stack involves references, which needs
an object hierarchy and testing.


Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'chemtrail'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install chemtrail
